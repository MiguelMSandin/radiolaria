# Taxonomically curated and annotated publicly available 18S rDNA gene sequences of Radiolaria

Following the steps described in [curation_pipeline.md](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/curation_pipeline.md), here you can find a **curated reference fasta file of radiolaria sequences** in [files/pr2_rads_updated.fasta](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/files/pr2_rads_updated.fasta) and the detailed associated information table in [files/pr2_Radiolaria_MMS.xlsx](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/files/pr2_Radiolaria_MMS.xlsx).

Sequence names in the fasta file have been given the following structure separated by "|":  
Class, Order, Superfamily, Family, Species, Symbiotic_relationships, genbank_accession  
For further details, please see [Step 8](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/curation_pipeline.md#step-8-final-taxonomic-annotation-and-corrections) and [summary and concluding remarks](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/curation_pipeline.md#summary-and-concluding-remarks) from the [curation pipeline](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/Radiolaria_reference/blob/master/curation_pipeline.md).

## Further uploads and improvemnts
- Complete or partial (D1+D2) 28S rDNA gene reference sequences.
- Manually corrected reference alignment of most relevant genetic diversity (for phylogenetic reconstruction purposes).
- Editable phylogenetic trees.
- Easily accesible R scripts for its implementation in the terminal console (as Rscript).
