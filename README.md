Briefly:  
## Taxonomic curation of environmental sequences associated to Radiolaria  
All environmental 18S rDNA sequences publicly available (as July 2020) were taxonomically curated as detailed in the [curation_pipeline.md](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/radiolaria/blob/master/curation_pipeline.md) and publicly accessible in the Protist Ribosomal Reference (PR2) database (from [v4.14.0](https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database/releases/tag/v4.14.0)).  
  
## Alignments for phylogenetic analyses  
in the folder [alignments](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/radiolaria/tree/master/alignments) there are:  
- An alignment containing [18S rDNA](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/radiolaria/blob/master/alignments/all_18S_filtered_align-linsi.fasta.gz) sequences (untrimmed) for future references  
- An alignment containing [28S rDNA](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/radiolaria/blob/master/alignments/all_28S_filtered_align-linsi.fasta.gz) sequences (untrimmed) for future references  
- The [concatenated alignment](https://github.com/MiguelMSandin/radiolaria/blob/master/alignments/all_filtered_align-linsi_trim05.fasta.gz) used to infer the main phylogeny of Radiolaria (trimmed)
